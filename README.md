## What is this?
Blueprint Tech Assessments are a variety of questions and challenges used to evaluate an individual's technical ability. The assessments vary across different programming languages and technologies including Python, Apache Spark and Azure Synapse (to name a few).

These assessments are intended to reduce the amount of time spent in human-to-human technical evaluations. They are not intended to remove the need for human-to-human technical evaluations.

## How it works
Your assessment coordinator will send you a link to a specific assessment. Unless otherwise specified, assessments should be completed in less than 24 hours. 

To submit your answers to the assigned assessment, clone this repo and create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) in this repository. Your pull request should contain the answers to all the questions and challenges in the assigned assessment (unless otherwise specified).

If you have questions about the assessment, submit an [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to this repository.

## FAQ

### Q. When trying to push my code, I get the following error: 
`fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/BlueprintTechnologies/blueprint-tech-assessments.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403`

A. This issue often arises when you have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on your Github account and use your password to authenticate. When 2FA is enabled, you must use a personal access token instead of your password. More information on creating a personal access token in Github available at https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token.
